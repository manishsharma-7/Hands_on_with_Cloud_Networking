## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about the core building blocks of cloud networking, including how to design, secure, and manage virtual networks in AWS. By the end of the 9 projects, I will have built a complete Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) from scratch, connected resources across different environments, implemented security and monitoring, and documented each step for my portfolio. I'm learning about cloud networking because it‚Äôs a critical skill for building secure, scalable applications in the cloud‚Äîand it's in high demand across the tech industry.

Cloud networking is the use of cloud-based services to manage and connect our IT resources, without owning the physical hardware. Before the cloud, companies had to build and maintain their own expensive networks‚Äîwith servers, cables, data centers, and IT staff.

With cloud networking, providers like AWS handle all the physical infrastructure. We simply use and pay for the network resources we need, when we need them. It‚Äôs like using a shared postal system instead of running our own delivery company‚Äîfaster, more flexible, and cost-effective.

Behind the scenes, real hardware still exists, but it‚Äôs "virtualized"‚Äîshared, managed, and accessed through software instead of physical cables and machines.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will dedicate 4 hours per week to progressing through the networking series. I will maintain accountability by systematically tracking my progress in a journal. Upon successful completion of all nine projects, I will reward myself with a celebratory meal.

### What are networks?

A network is a system that connects computers and devices so they can share information, resources, and services. Just like sending a birthday card through the postal system, data in a network is split into smaller packets, sent to a destination using an IP address, and reassembled on arrival.

Whether we‚Äôre checking our email, streaming a movie, or sharing a photo, we‚Äôre using a network. These data packets constantly move between devices, creating what's known as network traffic‚Äîthe lifeblood of how the internet and digital communication work.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private section of the AWS network where we can control how our resources communicate and how traffic flows in and out. It‚Äôs like having our own secure and customizable network inside the cloud.

This helps organizations by allowing them to:
- Control who can access their applications
- Protect sensitive data through network isolation and security rules
- Manage how different parts of their system communicate
- Decide which resources should have internet access and which should stay private

VPCs form the foundation of secure, scalable cloud applications and are essential for designing cloud infrastructure effectively.

Here are the 9 connected projects, each one taking 1-2 hours to complete:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Build a Virtual Private Cloud (./legendary-aws-networks-vpc.md) - Create the foundation of your network
2Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Traffic Flow and Security - Control traffic in your network
3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Private Subnet - Set up isolated sections of your VPC
4Ô∏è‚É£ Launching VPC Resources - Add servers and services to your network
5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing VPC Connectivity - Verify network communication works
6Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Peering - Connect multiple VPCs together
7Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Monitoring with Flow Logs - Track and analyze network traffic
8Ô∏è‚É£ Access S3 from a VPC - Connect your VPC to AWS storage services
9Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Endpoints - Optimize connections to AWS services
